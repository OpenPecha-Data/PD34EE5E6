Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Dodrupchen Rinpoche
from the words of Dodrupchen Rinpoche & Dudjom Rinpoche

Namo guru!

chok sum kündü tsawé lama la
To the root guru, who embodies the Three Supreme Jewels,
solwa deb so tukjé chen gyi zik
I pray: please look upon me with your eyes of compassion!
rangjung semnyi ösal chökü dön
Bless me, so that I may realize directly and without error
manor ngönsum tokpar jingyi lob
The naturally arising, clear-light nature of mind, the dharmakāya!

lumé kyabné gyatsö jin tu yi
Through the power of the ocean-like, unfailing sources of refuge,
jikme tubten trinlé palbar gyi
May the dance-like emanation of Jikmé Tubten Trinlé Palbar’s
sang sum trulpé rol gar nyur jön né
Secret body, speech and mind swiftly reappear
lab chen ten drö shyedön tarchin shok
And accomplish his vast vision for the teachings and sentient beings!

The first stanza contains the blessed words of the lord of refuge and wish-fulfilling jewel
Dodrupchen Rinpoche himself, and the second has been adapted slightly from Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche’s
composition. Thus, the crazy tulku of Nubri, Tenpei Nyima, who was the lowliest
of this master’s disciples, joined the petals of his ten fingers at his heart and offered
this prayer.
