A Prayer for the Swift Return of the Fourth Kyabje Dodrupchen Rinpoche
by Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche

tek chok ösal dorjé tsemö lam
In these decadent times, you protected the teachings and those fortunate enough to follow you
künkhyen yabsé ringluk mindrol gyi
With the ripening empowerments and liberating instructions of the path of the supreme vehicle,
kalden jedzin nyikdü ten drö gön
The vajra pinnacle of natural luminosity, the tradition of the omniscient father and son,1
tubten trinlé palbar solwa deb
Tupten Trinlé Palbar, to you I pray.

gön khyé shyiwé ying su mi nalwar
Protector, do not remain in the peace of the dharmadhātu,
lar yang ten dang drowé palgön du
But return as a glorious protector of the teachings and beings.
yangtrul dawa shyönnü tsul ten né
Reveal your youthful, moonlike emanation
nyik dro tsenmö gön du nyur jön sol
To help us through the dark night of degeneration – return quickly, I pray.

In response to a request from the great Khenpo Katayana, I, the one who holds the name of Rabjam
Tulku, adapted the supplication to the Fourth Kyabje Dodrupchen Rinpoche by Kyabje Dilgo
Khyentse Rinpoche to suit our present purpose on the 30th day of the 11th month of the
Iron Ox year (1 February 2022).
